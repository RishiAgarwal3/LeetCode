#This one is a bit tricky since it involves a bit of thinking but upon close examination we can see that it represents a fibonacci series with shifting one index


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 1, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
